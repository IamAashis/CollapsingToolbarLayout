        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="intro">The magnificent Langtang valley and the Himalayas are visible from the top of Tsergo Ri peak, which is located in the Langtang valley trekking region and rises 5033 meters above sea level. The same views are also visible from Kyanjin Ri, which is located not far from Kyanjin Gompa and rises 4773 meters and is only a two-hour hike away. However, it takes 5 hours to hike Tserko Ri to the top and 3 hours to return to Kyanjin Gompa. For the day climb to the Tsergo Ri summit, you must carry a packed lunch from your Kyanjin Gompa tea house. Views of Yala Peak (5,520 m), Langtang Ri (7,205 m), Langtang Lirung (7,227 m), and Naya Khang (5,844 m) are available from Tsergo Ri. If you want to summit Kyanjin Ri Peak and Tsergo Ri Peak, as well as Langshisha Ri Peak (6 427 meters), you should think about taking the Langtang Valley Trek. If you have more time, you might want to explore the Gosaikuda walk and the Tamang Heritage Trail, which are both 7-day treks from Kathmandu to the Langtang Valley and back. In comparison to other trekking areas, this one has a more attractive trekking environment, and it is primarily populated by indigenous Buddhist Sherpa and Tamang people. Long ago, these individuals crossed the Kerong border region on their way from Tibet. By the way, the locals also call Tsergo Ri Tserko Ri. Furthermore, the names Tsergo Ri and Tserko Ri are both shown on the map, although either name refers to the same summit. If anyone has any questions about trekking in the Langtang valley, please don\'t hesitate to contact us.</string>
    <string name="other_info">Although the Tserko Ri walk is long and difficult, it rewards hikers with a breathtaking perspective. You can bring a few things with you to make your hike simpler and more practical. Due to the hike\'s duration, you might want to pack snacks like energy bars, dry fruits, and chocolate to keep from getting peckish. Additionally, you should bring enough water with you to prevent dehydration. If you have them, a trekking pole and a set of crampons are quite helpful. The extremely muddy nature of both walks makes crampons a definite need. You should also include a rain jacket and pants as part of your preparations for trekking the Tserko Ri hike from Kyanjin Gompa.</string>
